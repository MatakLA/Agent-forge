# Changelog

## 0.10.0 - 2026-10-08
**Workers with API keys.** Besides Antigravity subscriptions, a worker can now run Claude Code, Codex or Gemini CLI with an API
key (`bin/worker-add N --runtime claude|codex|gemini`, or the dashboard). Keys stay in the secrets directory and reach only the
agent's environment; each runtime may reach only its provider's API host (the CLIs' update checks, telemetry and discovery
calls are switched off - measured with a logging proxy). Hard caps: USD per run (Claude Code's own `--max-budget-usd`), USD per
day for all projects, tool calls per run. API workers are overflow by default. A rejected key re-queues the task and pauses the
worker. Event formats, resume and cost were verified with the real CLIs against a fake API (`tests/test_runtimes.sh`).

**GitHub and GitLab.** A project can live on GitHub or GitLab (cloud or self-hosted): approved branches are pushed there and
merged through pull / merge requests under the repository's own protection, upstream main is synced back every minute. Workers
never reach GitHub/GitLab or the token. The dashboard asks where a new project's code lives. `bin/upstream`, docs/UPSTREAM.md,
`tests/test_upstream.py`.

**Install in one command.** `scripts/install.sh [--demo]`, `deploy/cloud-init.yaml`, a demo project in `examples/demo`.

**License.** Source-available under the Sustainable Use License: free to use and change for yourself and inside your company;
selling it or offering it as a paid / hosted service needs a commercial license (`LICENSE`, `LICENSE_EE.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`
with a contributor license agreement).

**Dashboard.** English only (one language, no client-side translation layer); deep links (`#tab=queue&project=p&task=0004-x`);
the Live tab shows only running runs and those finished in the last minutes; API workers show their runtime and spend.

**Proof for newcomers.** Screenshots and a tour GIF from invented demo data (`tools/screenshots.sh`, `tools/demo_state.py`),
a CI workflow that installs everything on a fresh VM and runs the integration tests (`.github/workflows/install.yml`),
`ROADMAP.md`, `tools/publish-snapshot` (publishes the tree as one commit without private history).

**Security.** The gate refuses branches that add API keys, tokens or private keys (was: a warning for some patterns).
`bin/worker-add` no longer passes the Forgejo admin token on curl's command line.

## 0.9.0 - 2026-10-07
First versioned release. Highlights since the extraction from a private setup:

**Efficiency** (data from ~400 runs: token-cap runs used 38 % of the quota) - context pack per task from a deterministic code
map, self-check with fixes in the same agent conversation, push after every run, pre-split of tasks owning many files, model
routing and A/B tests with quota-per-merged-task metrics, planning ahead and LLM-free maintenance while quota is out.

**Owner controls** - goals, backlog order and answers to the planner's questions from the dashboard (answers are kept in
`decisions.md` and bind later plans); per-project kill switch and `--all`; settings, workers (with browser login) and new
projects from the dashboard; notifications via ntfy / Slack / Discord / webhook; `bin/doctor`.

**Any language** - `TEST_CMD` and `GATE_IMAGE` per project (also editable in the dashboard's Settings → Project).

**Security** - dashboard Host check (DNS rebinding), CSRF header, no framing, CSP, optional `DASHBOARD_TOKEN`; Forgejo tokens
no longer on git command lines; nothing is pushed from a run with a HIGH egress alarm.

**Fixes**
- Dashboard froze on stale data after ~14 h: tail processes leaked pipes until the open-file limit; finished runs' panes were
  re-created every ~95 s.
- Parallel gate steps shared one rebase clone: interleaved rebases could push one branch's result to another branch.
- Freshly opened PRs looked conflicted (Forgejo's mergeability check still running) and were sent back to the worker.
- The kill switch re-tripped after "Continue": stops by the kill switch, token caps and quota stops counted as failures.
- A run whose supervisor died (reboot, OOM) left its task "running" forever; after a reboot a reused pid could make a worker look
  busy forever.
- A fresh checkout crashed when planning (missing `tasks/`); malformed planner JSON made the loop re-plan (and re-pay) every
  tick; two goals created in the same second overwrote each other; concurrent backlog/state writes lost updates.
- Claude Code failures that were not usage limits were retried every tick; LLM call kinds were mislabelled under parallel calls.
- Maintenance reported "main is red" for a project without tests or when Docker failed.
- Timeline mixed the runs of all projects; the remote dashboard assumed the user `dev`.
- A worker out of weekly quota logged the same event every 3 minutes for days and re-read its quota each time (now once per
  change, re-checked every 30 min when the reset is far; ISO reset times were never parsed).
